# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: *Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn*.
- **MySQL** : *Database design, SQL CRUD, Aggregations, Joins*.
- **PowerBI**: *Data modeling, DAX, Visualizations, KPIs*.
- **Tools**: *Jupyter Notebook, Power BI Desktop, MySQL Workbench*.

# 🔍 Key Features

- *Cleaned & processed banking dataset with Python*.
- *Univariate, bivariate & multivariate analysis*.
- *SQL queries for customer segmentation & risk analysis*.
- *Power BI dashboard for interactive financial insights*.
- *Relationship modeling between banking products*.
- *Data storytelling with KPIs and visuals*.

# 📊 Key Insights

- **Majority of customers fall under Risk Rating 1 & 2, showing a low-to-moderate risk profile.*
